# :bulb: A Guide to Production Level Deep Learning :clapper: :scroll:  :ferry:
[NOTE: This repo is still under development, and any feedback to make it better is welcome :blush: ]

Deploying deep learning models in production can be challenging, as it is far beyond training models with good performance. Several distinct components need to be designed and developed in order to deploy a production level deep learning system (seen below):

This repo aims to be an engineering guideline for building production-level deep learning systems which will be deployed in real world applications. 

The material presented here is borrowed from [Full Stack Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com) (by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) at UC Berkeley, [Josh Tobin](http://josh-tobin.com/) at OpenAI, and [Sergey Karayev](https://sergeykarayev.com/) at Turnitin), [TFX workshop](https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca/public/schedule/detail/79327) by [Robert Crowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-crowe/), and [Pipeline.ai](https://pipeline.ai/)'s [Advanced KubeFlow Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Advanced-KubeFlow/) by [Chris Fregly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cfregly/).

The following figure represents a high level overview of different components in a production level deep learning system:

</p>
In the following, we will go through each module and recommend toolsets and frameworks as well as best practices from practitioners that fit each component. 

# Full stack pipeline 
## 1. Data Management 
### 1.1 Data Sources 
* Supervised deep learning requires a lot of labeled data
* Labeling own data is costly! 
* Here are some resources for data: 
  * Open source data (good to start with, but not an advantage) 
  * Data augmentation (a MUST for computer vision, an option for NLP)
  * Synthetic data (almost always worth starting with, esp. in NLP)
### 1.2  Data Labeling 
* Requires: separate software stack (labeling platforms), temporary labor, and QC
* Sources of labor for labeling: 
  * Crowdsourcing (Mechanical Turk): cheap and scalable, less reliable, needs QC
  * Hiring own annotators: less QC needed, expensive, slow to scale 
  * Data labeling service companies:
    * [FigureEight](https://www.figure-eight.com/)  
* Labeling platforms: 
  * [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/): An annotation tool powered
by active learning (by developers of Spacy), text and image 
  * [HIVE](https://thehive.ai/): AI as a Service platform for computer vision  
  * [Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/): entire computer vision platform 
  * [Labelbox](https://labelbox.com/): computer vision  
  * [Scale](https://scale.com/) AI data platform (computer vision & NLP)

    
### 1.3. Data Storage 
* Data storage options: 
  * **Object store**: Store binary data (images, sound files, compressed texts) 
    * [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) 
    * [Ceph](https://ceph.io/) Object Store
  * **Database**: Store metadata (file paths, labels, user activity, etc). 
    * [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the right choice for most of applications, with the best-in-class SQL and great support for unstructured JSON. 
  * **Data Lake**: to aggregate features which are not obtainable from database (e.g. logs)
    * [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)
  * **Feature Store**: store, access, and share machine learning features 
 (Feature extraction could be computationally expensive and nearly impossible to scale, hence re-using features by different models and teams is a key to high performance ML teams). 
    * [FEAST](https://github.com/gojek/feast) (Google cloud, Open Source)
    * [Michelangelo Palette](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/) (Uber)
    * [Hopsworks](https://github.com/logicalclocks/hopsworks) (Hopsworks, Open Source)    
* Suggestion: At training time, copy data into a local or networked **filesystem** (NFS). <sup>[1](#fsdl)</sup> 

### 1.4. File Formats
* Different file formats may be used along different parts of the ML Pipeline, as shown in the figure below:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/alirezadir/Production-Level-Deep-Learning/blob/master/images/file-formats.png" title="" width="95%" height="95%">
</p>

* Feature engineering may be performed on legacy tabular file formats like .csv, or modern columnar formats like .parquet, .orc. Nested file formats like .json, .avro are less often used.

* Models are typically trained with data in files, and different frameworks have different native file formats. TensorFlow favors .tfrecords, PyTorch favors .npy, Scikit-Learn favors .csv files. Uber released .petastorm as a columnar file format with native readers for TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.

* File formats for model serving include: .pb (TensorFlow), .onnx (framework independent), .pkl (Scikit-Learn - picked python objects), and legacy formats such as .pmml.

### 1.5. Data Versioning 
* It's a "MUST" for deployed ML models:  
  **Deployed ML models are part code, part data**. <sup>[1](#fsdl)</sup>  No data versioning means no model versioning. 
* Data versioning platforms: 
  * [DVC](https://dvc.org/): Open source version control system for ML projects 
  * [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/): version control for data 
  * [Dolt](https://www.liquidata.co/): versioning for SQL database 
    
### 1.6. Data Processing 
* Training data for production models may come from different sources, including *Stored data in db and object stores*, *log processing*, and *outputs of other classifiers*.
* There are dependencies between tasks, each needs to be kicked off after its dependencies are finished. For example, training on new log data, requires a preprocessing step before training. 
* Makefiles are not scalable. "Workflow manager"s become pretty essential in this regard.
* **Workflow orchestration:**
  * [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) by Spotify
  * [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) by Airbnb: Dynamic, extensible, elegant, and scalable (the most widely used)
      * DAG workflow 
      * Robust conditional execution: retry in case of failure  
      * Pusher supports docker images with tensorflow serving 
      * Whole workflow in a single .py file

   </p>

  
### 2.4. Experiment management

* Development, training, and evaluation strategy:
  * Always start **simple** 
    * Train a small model on a small batch. Only if it works, scale to larger data and models, and hyperparameter tuning!  
  * Experiment management tools: 
  * [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
      * provides the visualization and tooling needed for ML experimentation  
  * [Losswise](https://losswise.com/) (Monitoring for ML)

  * Other solutions: 
    * Ray 
    * Horovod
    * [TensorFlow CollectiveAllReduce on PySpark](https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/goodbye-horovod-hello-collectiveallreduce)
    
## 3. Troubleshooting [TBD]

## 4. Testing and Deployment 
### 4.1. Testing and CI/CD
Machine Learning production software requires a more diverse set of test suites than traditional software:
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/alirezadir/Production-Level-Deep-Learning/blob/master/images/testing.png" title="" width="75%" height="75%">
   </p>
   
* Unit and Integration Testing: 
   * Types of tests: 
     * Training system tests: testing training pipeline
     * Validation tests: testing prediction system on validation set 
     * Functionality tests: testing prediction system on few important examples 
* Continuous Integration: Running tests after each new code change pushed to the repo 
 * SaaS for continuous integration: 
    * [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/): Open source Kubernetes native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs (incudes workflows, events, CI and CD).
    * [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/): Language-Inclusive Support, Custom Environments, Flexible Resource Allocation, used by instacart, Lyft, and StackShare.
    * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
    * [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/): Fast and stable builds, Open source agent runs on almost any machine and architecture, Freedom to use your own  tools and services
    * Jenkins: Old school build system  


### 4.2. Web Depolyment
  * Consists of a **Prediction System** and a **Serving System**
      * Prediction System: Process input data, make predictions 
      * Serving System (Web server): 
        * Serve prediction with scale in mind  
        * Use REST API to serve prediction HTTP requests
        * Calls the prediction system to respond 
  * Serving options: 
      * 1. Deploy to VMs, scale by adding instances 
      * 2. Deploy as containers, scale via orchestration 
          * Containers 
              * Docker 
          * Container Orchestration:
              * Kubernetes (the most popular now)
              * MESOS 
              * Marathon 
      * 3. Deploy code as a "serverless function"
      * 4. Deploy via a **model serving** solution
  * Model serving:
      * Specialized web deployment for ML models
      * Batches request for GPU inference 
      * Frameworks:
         * Tensorflow serving 
         * MXNet Model server 
         * Clipper (Berkeley)
         * SaaS solutions
            * [Seldon](https://www.seldon.io/): serve and scale models built in any framework on Kubernetes
            * [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com/)
   * Decision making: CPU or GPU? 
      * CPU inference:
         * CPU inference is preferable if it meets the requirements.
         * Scale by adding more servers, or going serverless. 
      * GPU inference: 
         * TF serving or Clipper 
         * Adaptive batching is useful 
  * (Bonus) Deploying Jupyter Notebooks:
      * [Kubeflow Fairing](https://github.com/kubeflow/fairing) is a hybrid deployment package that let's you deploy your *Jupyter notebook* codes! 
    
### 4.5 Service Mesh and Traffic Routing 
* Transition from monolithic applications towards a distributed microservice architecture could be challenging. 
* A **Service mesh** (consisting of a network of microservices) reduces the complexity of such deployments, and eases the strain on development teams.
  * [Istio](https://istio.io/): a service mesh to ease creation of  a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, with few or no code changes in service code. 
### 4.4. Monitoring:
* Purpose of monitoring: 
   * Alerts for downtime, errors, and distribution shifts 
   * Catching service and data regressions 
* Cloud providers solutions are decent 
* [Kiali](https://kiali.io/):an observability console for Istio with service mesh configuration capabilities. It answers these questions: How are the microservices connected? How are they performing?
* [Hopsworks](https://github.com/logicalclocks/hopsworks): online models have their predictions logged to a Kafka topic, and a Spark Streaming of Flink application monitors the model for concept drift, data drift, model drift, and other anomalies.
